As I understand it, the first person has a 1/10 chance of winning, and if they don't, there's 9 pieces left, and the second person will have a winning chance of 1/9, and so on. It seems like the chance for each person winning the lot increases after each unsuccessful draw until a winner appears. As far as I know, each person has an equal chance of winning the lot, but my brain can't really compute."

It was originally meant to fly in 2020 but they've been having trouble getting it off the ground for years thanks to all sorts of issues. I feel like the market's going to be really rough for it in 2026 with Starlink and probably Kuiper as competitors, but it seems like the Canadian government wants it so maybe it'll do fine.","Common F9 win. Reliability and high cadence ftw. Blue needs to update their website now too hehehe.", "The Telesat program is maddening. The Canadian government has invested about $1.5 billion in it so far, with a goal of connecting 40,000 rural households At the current hardware pricing deal, they could buy dishies that work today and connect the same 40,000 households for $8 million. 99.5% cheaper."]
